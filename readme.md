## Small STM32L0 based modulation source PCB

### Work in progress

#### The idea is:
- a tiny pcb
- four analog inputs
- two digital inputs
- two digital inputs
- one digital output
- it can be configured for various modulation duties, such as
    - a dual LFO
    - a single ADSR
    - other things?
- you could drop it into various projects that need a modulation source
